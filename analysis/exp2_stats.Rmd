# Load data

Read data, preprocessed from PCIbex output. See data/exp2_data_readme
for more details.

```{r}
d_all <- read.csv("../data/exp2_data.csv", stringsAsFactors=TRUE) %>%
  rename("Biographies"="Story") #rename to match labeling in paper

d_all$Participant <- as.factor(d_all$Participant)
d_all$PSA <- as.factor(d_all$PSA)
d_all$Biographies <- as.factor(d_all$Biographies)
d_all$X <- NULL

str(d_all)
```

Set up contrast coding for Pronoun Type. The first contrast compares
they to he+she. The second contrast compares he to she.

```{r}
contrasts(d_all$Pronoun)=cbind("_T_HS"=c(.33,.33,-.66), 
                               "_H_S"=c(-.5,.5, 0))
contrasts(d_all$Pronoun)
```

Set up contrast coding for PSA and Biographies conditions. .5 are the
conditions related to singular they (gendered language PSA, they/them
biographies); -.5 are the unrelated conditions (unrelated PSA, he/him
and she/her biographies).

```{r}
contrasts(d_all$PSA)=cbind("_GenLang"=c(-.5,.5))
contrasts(d_all$PSA)

contrasts(d_all$Biographies)=cbind("_They"=c(-.5,.5))
contrasts(d_all$Biographies)
```

Remove pet and job rows, and the columns that aren't used in the models.

```{r}
d <- d_all %>% filter (M_Type=="pronoun") %>%
  select(Participant, Condition, PSA, Biographies, Name, Pronoun, 
         M_Acc, M_Response, P_Acc, P_Response)
```

By-participant mean accuracy for memory and production tasks.

```{r}
d_subj <- d %>% group_by(PSA, Biographies, Participant, Pronoun) %>%
          summarize(M_Mean=mean(M_Acc), P_Mean=mean(P_Acc))
```

By-participant mean accuracy for production, split by memory accuracy.

```{r}
d_acc <- d %>% group_by(PSA, Biographies, Participant, Pronoun, M_Acc) %>%
          summarize(P_Mean=mean(P_Acc))
```

If each participant selected/produced they/them at least once.

```{r}
d_they <- d %>% 
  mutate(M_IsThey=ifelse(M_Response=="they/them", 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(P_IsThey=ifelse(P_Response=="they/them", 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(Participant, Condition, PSA, Biographies) %>%
  summarize(M_Count=sum(M_IsThey),
            P_Count=sum(P_IsThey)) %>%
  mutate(M_UseThey=ifelse(M_Count!=0, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(P_UseThey=ifelse(P_Count!=0, 1, 0))
```

# Memory

### Descriptive Stats

Mean accuracy for all three memory question types.

```{r}
d_all %>% group_by(M_Type) %>%
          summarise(acc=mean(M_Acc))
```

Mean accuracy, split by Pronoun Type, PSA, and Biographies conditions.
[Both = gendered language PSA + they biographies; PSA = gendered
language PSA + he/she biographies; Story = unrelated PSA + they
biographies; Neither = unrelated PSA + he/she biographies.]

```{r}
d %>% group_by(Pronoun, Condition) %>%
      summarise(acc=mean(M_Acc))    
```

90-95% of participants selected they/them at least once.

```{r}
d_they %>% group_by(Condition) %>% 
  summarize(Select_They=sum(M_UseThey)) %>%
  mutate(n=80) %>%
  mutate(prop=Select_They/n)
```

### Model

Full model has interactions between Pronoun (2 contrasts), PSA, and
Biographies; random intercepts and slopes by participant and item.
buildmer finds the maximal model that will converge (but doesn't then go
backward to remove non-significant terms, the default setting). The
final model includes all fixed effects/interactions and random
intercepts by name.

```{r}
model_m_full <- M_Acc ~ Pronoun * PSA * Biographies + 
                (Pronoun|Participant) + (Pronoun|Name)

model_m <- buildmer(model_m_full, d, 
           family="binomial", direction=c("order"))

summary(model_m)
```

# Production

### Descriptive Stats

Mean accuracy, split by Pronoun Type, PSA, and Biographies conditions.
[Both = gendered language PSA + they biographies; PSA = gendered
language PSA + he/she biographies; Story = unrelated PSA + they
biographies; Neither = unrelated PSA + he/she biographies.]

```{r}
d %>% group_by(Pronoun, Condition) %>%
      summarise(m=mean(P_Acc))    
```

### Model

Same model specifications as before. The maximal model contains all
fixed effects/interactions and by-item random intercepts.

```{r}
model_p_full <- P_Acc ~ Pronoun * PSA * Biographies + 
                (Pronoun|Participant) + (Pronoun|Name)

model_p <- buildmer(model_p_full, d, 
           family="binomial", direction=c("order"))

summary(model_p)
```

### Three-Way Interaction

The main model has Helmert coding for Pronoun and Effects coding (.5,
-.5) for PSA and Biographies. This means Pronoun (T vs HS) \* PSA \*
Biographies is testing the interaction between Pronoun and PSA across
both Biographies conditions.

Dummy coding Biographies with they/them biographies as 1 and he/she
biographies as 0 tests the interaction between Pronoun and PSA for just
the he/she Biographies:

```{r}

d %<>% mutate(BioDummy_T=Biographies)
contrasts(d$BioDummy_T)=cbind("_They1"=c(0,1))

model_p_dummyT <- glmer(P_Acc ~ Pronoun * PSA * BioDummy_T + (1|Name),
                  data=d, family="binomial")

summary(model_p_dummyT)

```

Conversely, dummy coding Biographies with he/she biographies as 1 and
they biographies as 0 tests the interaction between Pronoun and PSA for
just the they Biographies.

```{r}
d %<>% mutate(BioDummy_HS=Biographies)
contrasts(d$BioDummy_HS)=cbind("_HeShe"=c(1,0))

model_p_dummyHS <- glmer(P_Acc ~ Pronoun * PSA * BioDummy_HS + (1|Name),
                        data=d, family="binomial")
summary(model_p_dummyHS)
```

The three models to compare:

```{r}

interaction_1 <- tidy(model_p@model) %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>%
  filter(term=="Pronoun_T_HS" | term=="PSA_GenLang" |
           term=="Pronoun_T_HS:PSA_GenLang") %>%
  rename("AcrossBio_Est"="estimate", "AcrossBio_p"="p.value")

interaction_2 <- tidy(model_p_dummyT) %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>%
  filter(term=="Pronoun_T_HS" | term=="PSA_GenLang" |
           term=="Pronoun_T_HS:PSA_GenLang") %>%
  rename("HeSheBio_Est"="estimate", "HeSheBio_p"="p.value") %>%
  left_join(interaction_1)

interaction_3 <- tidy(model_p_dummyHS) %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>%
  filter(term=="Pronoun_T_HS" | term=="PSA_GenLang" |
           term=="Pronoun_T_HS:PSA_GenLang") %>%
  rename("TheyBio_Est"="estimate", "TheyBio_p"="p.value") %>%
  left_join(interaction_2)

interaction_3

```

The estimate for the PSA\*Pronoun interaction is -2.34 for the he/she
biographies and -1.47 for the they biographies, which means that the
pronoun PSA reduced the relative difficulty of they/them more when
paired with the he/she biographies than with they biographies.
Connecting to the plot, the PSA-Neither difference is larger than
Both-Story difference.

### Producing they/them at least once

```{r}
d %>% filter(P_Response=="they/them") %>%
  group_by(Condition) %>% 
  summarize(they=n_distinct(Participant)) %>%
  mutate(n=80) %>%
  mutate(prop=they/n)
```

Model with whether each participant produced they/them at least once as
the outcome variable. Higher with the gendered language PSA, no effect
of Biographies, vaguely trending interaction.

```{r}
model_p_they <- glm(P_UseThey ~ PSA * Biographies, 
                d_they, family="binomial")
summary(model_p_they)
```

# Memory Predicting Production

### Descriptive Stats

```{r}
d %>% group_by(Pronoun, Condition, M_Acc) %>%
      summarise(m=mean(P_Acc))    
```

Combining the two measures, there are 4 possible patterns: getting both
right, getting both wrong, getting just memory right, and getting just
production right.

```{r}
mp_acc <- d %>% 
          mutate(BothRight=ifelse(M_Acc==1 & P_Acc==1, 1, 0)) %>%
          mutate(BothWrong=ifelse(M_Acc==0 & P_Acc==0, 1, 0)) %>%
          mutate(MemOnly=ifelse(M_Acc==1 & P_Acc==0, 1, 0)) %>%
          mutate(ProdOnly=ifelse(M_Acc==0 & P_Acc==1, 1, 0)) %>%
          pivot_longer(cols=c(BothRight, BothWrong, MemOnly, ProdOnly),
                       names_to="Combined_Accuracy") %>%
          group_by(Pronoun, Combined_Accuracy) %>%
          summarise(m=mean(value))
mp_acc
```

### Model

Maximal model has interactions between Pronoun (2 contrasts), Memory
Accuracy, PSA, and Biographies, then random intercepts by item.

```{r}
model_mp_full <- P_Acc ~ Pronoun * PSA * Biographies * M_Acc + 
                (Pronoun|Participant) + (Pronoun|Name)

model_mp <- buildmer(model_mp_full, d, 
                     family="binomial", direction=c("order"))

summary(model_mp)
```
